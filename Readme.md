Health Plan RAG Chatbot API
This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot API designed to answer questions exclusively from a provided set of health plan documents (PDFs and DOCX). It is built with a modern GenAI stack to ensure accurate, source-based responses.

If the information is not found in the documents, the chatbot will correctly respond with "I don't know".

Use Case
This RAG assistant is trained on insurance-related documents, specifically the "Summary of Benefits and Coverage." It acts as an intelligent FAQ assistant to help users quickly understand their health plan without needing to call customer support.

It helps users:

Understand deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket maximums.

Find out what services are covered or excluded.

Know what costs to expect for medical events.

Avoid long wait times for common questions.

âœ¨ Features
 Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Answers are generated based only on the content of the uploaded documents.

 Tool-Based Agent: Uses a sophisticated agent built with LangGraph to orchestrate retrieval and generation steps.

 "I Don't Know" Fallback: Gracefully handles questions that cannot be answered from the source material.

 Source Citations: Includes the names of the source documents used to generate the answer.

 CORS-Enabled REST API: Built with FastAPI to allow easy integration with any frontend application.

 Interactive API Docs: Comes with a Swagger UI for easy testing and exploration of the API endpoints.
